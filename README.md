# Powershell-Wallpaper
This project is a script that allows a user's wallpaper to be quickly changed using a single command.
One the script an a necasary photo have be hosted online, the wallpaper can be changed using:
`iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerd8622/Powershell-Wallpaper/main/change.ps'))`
This can be combined with a HID keyboard emulator for a bit of fun.
